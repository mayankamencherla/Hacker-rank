# Unions, difference etc don't make a difference to the set, therefore the update function is used
# this snippet shows how to use it. 
# I use getattr to just use whatever passed in command to the set and let the in built functions take care of itself
# GREAT TRICK!!

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
