# Finding the angle MBC where M is the mid-point of hypotenuse of right angle triangle.
# https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-angle?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=legacy

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# angle BMC = 90, and therefore MBC is equal to ACB = cos inverse of BC/hyp
# This is because the median divides the triangle into 2 isosceles triangles. Therefore ACB = MBC

import math

AB = input(); BC = input()

hyp = math.sqrt( math.pow(AB,2) + math.pow(BC,2) )

print ( str(int(round(math.degrees( math.acos(BC/hyp) ) ))) + "Â°" )
